## Selection Sort

### 🔄 What is Selection Sort?

Selection Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms:

- It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the front.
- It’s intuitive but not the most efficient for large datasets.

### ⚙️ Time Complexity
- **O(n²)**: Since it involves nested loops, making it inefficient for large datasets.
  
### 🧠 Space Complexity
- **O(1)**: It’s an **in-place sorting algorithm**, meaning it doesn’t require extra space beyond the input array.

### 💡 Use Case
- Great for small lists or when memory usage is a concern.
- Useful when simplicity is preferred over performance.
