## Bubble Sort Algorithm

### Overview
Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top (beginning of the list), while larger elements "sink" to the bottom (end of the list) with each pass.

### How It Works
1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare the first pair of adjacent elements. If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
3. Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison and swapping process.
4. Continue this process until the end of the list is reached. This completes one full pass.
5. Repeat the above steps for all elements, excluding the last sorted element from the next pass (since it's already in its correct position).
6. Continue until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.
